suning-client
=============

Actully, this is a project that used a match for suning. Now, the match end, so I put it in github that everyone 
can learn it. If you want to use this code, you should have a Qt develepment to test or debug them. And this codes
based on Linux everionment. The mainly problem is this codes used some Linux system calls. More details wrote into
project, read them carefully.
